# A Very Basic Facebook Blocker

This is a simple Facebook-blocking tool I made for myself, after wasting hours of time that I could otherwise spend doing great things.

It is made of a few lines of JavaScript, which simply replace the `<body>` of Facebook with a light-grey `<div>`, containing a large message saying to "*STOP!*", and do something productive.

This code is one of the 'userscripts' I have within an app called Tampermonkey; each time it detects I'm on facebook.com, it will fire this block of code. [Get the Chrome add-on here!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)

Feel free to use this code as you see fit!
